This plugin adds an Insert Emoji button into the post content editor.

It will also enable autocomplete of emoji by typing a colon and then an emoji name, like ":smile".

== Screenshots ==

1. After installing the plugin you'll have an Insert Emoji button in your editor.
2. Clicking the button opens up a toolbar to search for and insert emoji into your post content.
3. Also try autocomplete by entering a colon and then the name of an emoji, like ":smile". You can navigate with the left and right arrow keys, and press enter to insert the Emoji. Press escape to close the window.
